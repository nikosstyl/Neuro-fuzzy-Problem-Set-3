\section{Problem 10}
The min-max composition of fuzzy relations is a method for combining two fuzzy relations to produce a new fuzzy relation. \\
Given two fuzzy relations $R1$ and $R2$, with membership functions $\mu_{\tilde{R1}}(x,y)$ and $\mu_{\tilde{R2}}(y,z)$ respectively, the min-max composition $R = R1 \circ R2 $ has a membership function defined for each pair $(x,z)$ by:
\begin{equation}
	\mu_R(x, z) = \max_{y} \min(\mu_{R1}(x, y), \mu_{R2}(y, z)
\end{equation}
For better understanding, we will analyse the expression
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\min(\mu_{R1}(x, y), \mu_{R2}(y, z)$: For a fixed $x$ and $z$, and for each intermediate value of $y$, we must find the minimum membership value between 
	�
	�
	1
	(
	�
	,
	�
	)
	μ 
	R1
	​
	(x,y) and 
	�
	�
	2
	(
	�
	,
	�
	)
	μ 
	R2
	​
	. This minimum value represents the strongest constraint on the relationship between 
	�
	x and 
	�
	z via the intermediary 
	�
	y.
	
\end{itemize}
